# 👋 Hi, I'm Shina Qin

I’ve explored many industries — from **multimedia design** to **software programming** — and after years of learning and hands-on experience, I’ve found my true passion lies in **software engineering**. I love building user-focused products, solving real-world problems, and continuously learning how to write cleaner, smarter, and more scalable code. Based in Melbourne, Australia, I thrive in collaborative teams and enjoy turning ideas into impactful applications using technologies like React, TypeScript, Node.js, and AWS.
